# GAS Sensor

#### Project Overview

The GAS Sensor project demonstrates how to interface a gas sensor with an Arduino Mega to detect and measure gas concentrations. This project utilizes an analog gas sensor to detect the presence of gases in the environment and calculate their concentration in parts per million (ppm). It provides a method to monitor air quality or detect specific gases based on sensor readings and threshold settings.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Analog GAS Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the GAS Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Output** to **Analog Pin A0**
   - **VCC** to **5V**
   - **GND** to **GND**

#### Instructions

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - No additional libraries are required for this project.

2. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the gas sensor module to the Arduino Mega as specified in the circuit setup section.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

4. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE to view the sensor voltage and calculated gas concentration (ppm).
   - Observe the serial monitor for gas detection notifications based on the predefined threshold.

#### Applications

- **Air Quality Monitoring:** Detect and measure various gases to monitor indoor or outdoor air quality.
- **Safety Systems:** Implement gas detection systems for early warning in hazardous environments.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Track changes in gas levels in agricultural or industrial settings.
- **Smart Home Applications:** Integrate gas sensors into home automation systems for safety and security.

#### Notes

- Calibration of the gas sensor may be required based on the specific sensor type and gas being detected. Refer to the sensor datasheet for calibration guidelines.
- Adjust the `thresholdPPM` variable to set the desired gas concentration threshold for triggering alerts or actions.
- Ensure proper ventilation and safety precautions when testing or using gas sensors in enclosed spaces or sensitive environments.
